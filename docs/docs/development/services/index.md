# Core Services

The MCP Gateway is built around a set of core services, each responsible for managing a specific aspect of the gateway's functionality. This service-oriented architecture helps to keep the codebase organized and modular.

## Service Overview

The following are the key services in the gateway:

-   **[Tool Service](./tool_service.md)**: Manages the entire lifecycle of tools, from registration to invocation.
-   **[Gateway Service](./gateway_service.md)**: Handles the federation of peer MCP gateways.
-   **[Server Service](./server_service.md)**: Manages the creation and configuration of "virtual servers".

These services work together to provide the full functionality of the MCP Gateway. Understanding their individual responsibilities and how they interact is key to understanding the overall architecture of the system.
